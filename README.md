# hello-world
Traditional hello-world project to get things going.
So far, I just read about other people projects here on GitHub, but now
I like to understand things better and use it's potential. 
I recently graduated as an engineer in the field of mechatronics and got a job as a software engineer. That's why I get started on GitHub. Hope for a great time here!
